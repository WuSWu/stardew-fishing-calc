# To Do
Targeted bait - The calculations are really hard, I'm halfway there!

More locations - Places like the mines and caldera are tricky, so I left them out for now. IIRC there are some special cases going on with the ginger island locations, I'll revisit them later.

River/Cave/Sea jellies - They're a bit weird, so for now you have to assume you can't catch them.

Magic bait currently doesn't support submarine fish, currently figuring out the UI for fish areas, send me ideas!

If I missed more things, let me know!
